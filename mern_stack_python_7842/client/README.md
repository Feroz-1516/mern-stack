# Getting Started with Flask React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and converted to use Flask on the backend.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `python app.py`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `pytest`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/usage.html) for more information.

### `python build.py`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/deploying/) for more information.
